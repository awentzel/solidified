# Example implementation for Solid

* [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/how-it-works) is a web ecosystem where you own every aspect of your data personal or otherwise.
* Say goodbye to handing out personal data to digital companies where we have no control of security, privacy, or access all in the name of some perceived value.
* The web becomes a collaborative read-write space, passing control from owners of a server, to the users of that system
* “… for all the good we’ve achieved, the web has evolved into an engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agendas.” --[Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web)
